##An analysis of MTA turnstile data  

Description:  WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer. The management has decided to place street teams at entrances to subway stations to collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to the gala. Our task is use MTA turnstile data to optimize the placement of street teams so that they can collect the most signatures from people who will attend the gala and contribute to its cause.   

Presentation slides and code are included in this repo.
